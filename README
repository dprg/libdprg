DPRG Cooperative Multitasking and Subsumption Library
 
Version 0.6

This is a small, fast, cooperative multitasking environment and a collection 
of commonly used C language functions for mobile robot applications. Initially
this code targets the Mini Robomind (MRM) microcontroller but will eventually
support additional microcontrollers. This library is based on code originally 
developed by David P. Anderson of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group. The
initial refactoring of the code into this stand-alone library was done by
R. Steven Rainwater of the DPRG. Additional code and ideas have been integrated
from other GPL'd project and contributed by various authors.
